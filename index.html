    <h2>All about me</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="info">
      I obtained my Bachelors in Engineering (B.E.) degree from Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, India in 2015 with First Class Honours. 
	  After that, I worked in a software company for one year as a web based application developer before starting my Master's degree.
	  I finished my master's degree (M.Sc.) from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2019.
	  At the same year, I started my doctoral studies at the Department of Informatics, TUM, funded by Nokia Bell Labs, Munich, which I am still pursuing.
	  So far I have published many peer-reviewed articles in prestigious journals and conferences, including IEEE TNSM, IEEE/IFIP CNSM, IEEE/IFIP NOMS, Elsevier COMNET, etc.
	  In 2021 I won the Student Travel Grant (STG) award for outstanding research work in the conference IEEE/IFIP CNSM 21.
	  <br><br>
	  Apart from the peer-reviewed articles, with the help of Nokia Bell Labs, so far I have filed over 10 patent applications during my doctoral studies.
	  I am also a regular contributor in mobile network standardization activities including 3GPP SA5, ETSI ZSM and O-RAN.
