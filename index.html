    <hr>
    <div class="info">
      From November 2019, I'll be starting my PhD in computer science from Dept. of Informatics, Technical University of Munich (TUM), funded by Bell Labs.
      Simultaneously, I'll be also working at Bell Labs, Munich as a research associate.
      Recently I finished my master's degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Technical University of Munich (TUM).
      My master's thesis was on content placement in connected edge networks under the supervision of <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/nishanth.sastry/" target="_blank">Dr. Nishanth Sastry</a> and <a href="https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lkn/team/mas-machuca-carmen/" target="_blank">Dr. Carmen Mas Machuca</a>.
      I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering (B.E.) from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/" target="_blank">Jadavpur University</a>, Kolkata (2011 - 2015) with first class honors.
      After that, I worked in a software company for one year as a web based application developer before starting my Master's degree at TUM.
      Along with my study, I have been also worked as a student researcher in Department of Informatics, TUM for two and a half years.
      Over a period of time, I have also continued research works remotely with <a href="http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~anand/" target="_blank">Dr. Anand Seetharam</a> on Information Centric Networking.
      <br><br>
      Apart from being a full-time telecommunication engineer, I am a very passionate hiker and musician also.
      To get more information about my hiking and musical activities, please check the <a href="activities.html" target="_blank">activities</a>page in my website.
