    <h2>All about me</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="info">
      Currently I am doing my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany.
      I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering (B.E.) from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/" target="_blank">Jadavpur University</a>, Kolkata (2011 - 2015) with first class honors.
      After that, I worked in a software company for one year as a web based application developer before starting my Master's degree at TUM.
      Along with my study, I have been also working as a student researcher in Department of Informatics, TUM.
      I recently finished my thesis on content placement in connected edge networks under the supervision of <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/nishanth.sastry/" target="_blank">Dr. Nishanth Sastry</a> and <a href="https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lkn/team/mas-machuca-carmen/" target="_blank">Dr. Carmen Mas Machuca</a>.
      Over a period of time, I have also continued research works remotely with <a href="http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~anand/" target="_blank">Dr. Anand Seetharam</a> on Information Centric Networking.
